Hi!

I am currently trying to build something of a repository to partly understand how it works and for a future career
in IT generally and more specifically in the field of testing

<!---
phumpeti/phumpeti is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
